# 1Password CLI Security Enhancements

This document describes the comprehensive security enhancements implemented for 1Password CLI operations in the ansible_home project.

## Overview

The 1Password CLI security enhancements provide robust protection through multiple layers of security controls including GPG signature verification, timeout handling, session management, secure keyring management, and authentication failure recovery.

## Security Features

### ✅ GPG Signature Verification for Downloads
- **Linux**: Full GPG signature verification using official 1Password signing keys
- **macOS**: Version validation and Homebrew security model verification
- **Implementation**: Validates cryptographic signatures to prevent tampered installations

### ✅ Timeout Handling for CLI Operations
- All 1Password CLI operations include configurable timeouts (default: 30 seconds)
- Prevents hanging operations and potential DoS attacks
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed operations

### ✅ Session Management and Token Validation
- Automatic session creation and renewal
- Session validity checking before each operation
- Secure session storage with proper file permissions (600)
- Automatic cleanup of expired or invalid sessions

### ✅ Secure Keyring Management
- Configuration directory permissions enforced (700)
- Session files secured with restrictive permissions (600)
- GPG keyring files validated for correct ownership and permissions
- Automatic permission remediation when issues are detected

### ✅ Authentication Failure Recovery Procedures
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Session invalidation and recreation on authentication failures
- Comprehensive logging of authentication events
- Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages

### ✅ CLI Version Validation and Updates
- Minimum version enforcement (requires 2.0.0+)
- Version compatibility checking during installation
- Automated validation prevents use of insecure older versions

## Security Scripts

### op-secure
Enhanced wrapper script for all 1Password CLI operations with security features:

```bash
# Basic usage
op-secure item get "My Login"

# Check session status
op-secure --session-status

# Validate installation
op-secure --validate

# Clear current session
op-secure --clear-session
```

**Features:**
- Timeout protection for all operations
- Automatic session management
- Retry logic with authentication failure recovery
- Comprehensive logging
- Permission validation and auto-remediation

### op-health-check
Comprehensive health check script for 1Password CLI security:

```bash
# Run complete health check
op-health-check
```

**Checks performed:**
- CLI installation verification
- Version compatibility validation
- Directory and file permission security
- Session file security validation
- Wrapper script availability
- Authentication status verification

## Configuration

### Security Configuration File
Location: `~/.config/op/config`

```bash
# Session timeout (in seconds)
SESSION_TIMEOUT=1800

# Maximum retry attempts for failed operations
MAX_RETRIES=3

# Enable secure logging
ENABLE_LOGGING=true

# Require biometric authentication when available
REQUIRE_BIOMETRIC=false

# Auto-lock session after inactivity (in seconds)
AUTO_LOCK_TIMEOUT=3600
```

### Environment Variables
- `OP_TIMEOUT`: Override default timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- `OP_MAX_RETRIES`: Override default retry count (default: 3)

## File Permissions

The security implementation enforces strict file permissions:

| Path | Permissions | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `~/.config/op/` | 700 | Configuration directory |
| `~/.config/op/session` | 600 | Session token storage |
| `~/.config/op/config` | 600 | Security configuration |
| `~/.config/op/op-secure.log` | 600 | Security operation logs |
| `/usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg` | 644 | GPG keyring (Linux) |

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

#### macOS Tests
- CLI installation and version validation
- Security wrapper script functionality
- Configuration directory security
- Health check functionality
- GPG signature verification for Homebrew packages

#### Linux Tests
- CLI installation with GPG signature verification
- GPG keyring security validation
- APT repository security configuration
- Security script installation and permissions
- Configuration directory security

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Run health check
~/.local/bin/op-health-check

# Test security wrapper
~/.local/bin/op-secure --validate

# Test session management
~/.local/bin/op-secure --session-status
```

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
The security enhancements protect against:
- **Supply chain attacks**: GPG signature verification
- **Privilege escalation**: Strict file permissions
- **Session hijacking**: Secure session storage and validation
- **DoS attacks**: Timeout and retry mechanisms
- **Authentication bypass**: Version validation and session management

### Security Assumptions
- Operating system integrity (trusted base system)
- Network security for package downloads (HTTPS/GPG verification)
- User account security (non-compromised user account)
- 1Password service availability and integrity

### Limitations
- Requires 1Password CLI version 2.0.0 or higher
- Session management depends on 1Password service availability
- Biometric authentication support varies by platform
- Some security features may require additional system configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Fix permissions automatically
~/.local/bin/op-secure --validate
```

#### Session Expiry Issues
```bash
# Clear and recreate session
~/.local/bin/op-secure --clear-session
~/.local/bin/op-secure --session-status
```

#### Version Compatibility Issues
- Upgrade 1Password CLI to version 2.0.0 or higher
- Run `op-health-check` to verify compatibility

### Logging

Security operations are logged to `~/.config/op/op-secure.log`:
```bash
# View recent security events
tail -f ~/.config/op/op-secure.log

# Check for authentication failures
grep "ERROR\|WARN" ~/.config/op/op-secure.log
```

## Implementation Details

The security enhancements are implemented across several components:

### Ansible Tasks
- `roles/localhost/tasks/1password-security.yml`: Core security module
- `roles/localhost/tasks/local-mac.yml`: macOS-specific integration
- `roles/localhost/tasks/local-linux.yml`: Linux-specific integration

### Test Coverage
- `roles/localhost/molecule/macos/tests/test_macos_specific.py`: macOS security tests
- `roles/localhost/molecule/linux/tests/test_linux_specific.py`: Linux security tests

### Security Scripts
- `~/.local/bin/op-secure`: Enhanced CLI wrapper
- `~/.local/bin/op-health-check`: Comprehensive health validation

## Compliance

These security enhancements align with:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Protect, Detect, Respond functions
- **OWASP Secure Coding Practices**: Input validation, authentication, session management
- **Industry Best Practices**: Defense in depth, principle of least privilege, fail-safe defaults
